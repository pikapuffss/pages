  In the fall of 1995, Carol Chen, Joyce Chu, Jenny Hsieh, Chetali Kuber, Trinh Le, Tina Wu, and Wendy Yang brought an Asian American sorority to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to enhance Asian Awareness and strengthen the voice of Asian American women.  With great heart and dedication, they watched their long-awaited dreams become a reality.  alpha Kappa Delta Phi colony status was granted on November 26, 1995.  Through the magical traditions of love and friendship that characterized the sorority itself, the seven women of the Charter Class became active sisters of alpha Kappa Delta Phi on March 16, 1996.

<h4>NATIONAL HISTORY</h4><br>
<img src="national charters.png" class="wide-image"> <img src="national charters 2.png" class="wide-image"><br>

alpha Kappa Delta Phi was established at the University of California, Berkeley in the fall of 1989. Four headstrong visionaries: Susan Kim, Fannie Pon, Jill Yoshimura and Reina Yuan, initiated the concept of having an organization that would provide them as well as other young college women the opportunity to experience sisterhood and to promote what they felt was integral to the development of successful women. After proposing their ideas to women at the Berkeley campus, they, along with ten strong and willful fellow women, became the founding sisters of alpha Kappa Delta Phi.
<br><br>
<h3>It is the sincere wish of the founding sisters that alpha Kappa Delta Phi continue to promote the ideals on which the organization was founded and to provide each woman with the resources, unique sisterly support, and understanding to achieve her goals in life.
  </h3><br>
Together as the charter class, they dedicated themselves to establishing a strong and lasting organization that would foster not only sisterhood, but scholarship, service, leadership, and Asian American awareness as well. The founding sisters: Betty Chu, Karin Co, Susan Kim, Nancy Lee, Sherri Leung, Annie Loo, Belinda Ma, Anita Ng, Serene Ngin, Fannie Pon, Josie Sun, Daisy Wu, Jill Yoshimura and Reina Yuan, came together to share one another’s goals for a promising union. These ideals were to later set the foundation and purpose of alpha Kappa Delta Phi.
<br><br>
The love and generosity that each member had for the organization were instrumental to the growth of alpha Kappa Delta Phi’s reputation as a sorority, as well as to the forging of unbreakable friendships. In its first step towards achieving widespread acknowledgement, alpha Kappa Delta Phi was recognized by the College Panhellenic Association of Berkeley, California on February 7, 1990, which date is celebrated annually as National Founders’ Day. The sisterhood has since then spread to prominent university campuses around the nation.
To meet the needs of the growing sisterhood, the National Board of alpha Kappa Delta Phi was established in May of 1993 at the National Convention in Santa Barbara, California.
